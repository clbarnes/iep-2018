# Miscellaneous

- `coordinates` ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/coordinates/))
- `smalldataviewer` ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/smalldataviewer/))

notes:

- A couple of very minor libraries I've released
- Made my life much easier

coordinates

- orientation-agnostic maths-compliant coordinate library
- Useful in cases where ordering switches
(e.g. pixel coords between C and fortran)

smalldataviewer

- tool useful for debugging small 3D image data
- compatible with wide variety of image formats
- fits into a python workflow much better than alternatives, which are
often very dependency-heavy or limited in file formats
