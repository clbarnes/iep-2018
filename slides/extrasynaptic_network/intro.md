# The multilayer connectome of *C. elegans*

- The first animal to have its physical connectome reconstructed
- Excellent genetic tools and expression data available

notes:

C. elegans is a nematode worm whose connectome was largely reconstructed
by White et al in the 80s.

Since then, advances in molecular biology have enabled us to infer a
great deal of neurotransmitter and receptor expression,
opening the possibility of reconstructing a putative extrasynaptic
network which would allow us to test whether the physical connectome's
gross structure really represented the flow of information through the
worm's nervous system.

As part of Bill Schafer's lab at the LMB, I worked with Barry Bentley
and others on the analysis of this network and this was published in 2016.
