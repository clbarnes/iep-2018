# Applications at scale

- Synapse area fraction
- Excitatory vs. inhibitory synapse size

notes:

Another branch of my project has been to integrate automated synapse
detections into our annotation workflow.

This has been on hold for a few months while some underlying issues were
resolved, but I've had promising news from collaborators which should
significantly enhance the synapse detector which I had been working with
previously.

Furthermore, the Saalfeld lab has recently come out with their own
synapse detection algorithm which I hope to apply to the larva, and have
made some progress towards this goal.

Having the automated synapse detections available will make a number of
analyses tractable.

Firstly, the synapse area fraction (to be compared with the synapse
contact fraction) as mentioned previously.

Another application would be to look at synapse size across different
cell types, particularly where those different cell types converge onto
the same postsynaptic target, and where the synapses are thought to have
different signs.

In the next layer of the chordotonal-basin circuit, lateral inhibitory
elements such as drunken, griddle and handle compete against ascending
and descending excitatory elements.

Motor neurons also have both GABA-ergic and glutaminergic inputs.

If the synapses of different populations of neurons were
discriminable by size, this would be a valuable element in recognising
neuron classes, especially in larger, more sparse volumes (like the L3
larva and the adult) where there is likely a great deal of conserved
circuitry but too many cells to do an exhaustive reconstruction.
