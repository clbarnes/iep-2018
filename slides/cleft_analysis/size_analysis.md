# Cleft size analysis

- Chordotonal &rarr; Basin
- Olfactory Receptor Neurons ORN &rarr; Projection Neurons PN

notes:

As a pilot study, I annotated the synaptic cleft areas in the first
layer of sensory projections in two different circuits.

These circuits are present bilaterally and in each, the two sides
show broadly similar patterns of connectivity.

However, while analyses using synapse contact number has
been enough to discriminate between strongly and weakly connected
components, there are significant differences between the left and right
sides in terms of absolute contact number.

Chordotonals are a class of 8 mechanosensory neurons in the VNC.

One class of their targets are the first order projection neuron
"basins". This interaction has been implicated in a number of
behavioural choice paradigms, in particular the response to threat.

The chordotonal-basin circuit is repeated both laterally and segmentally.

In the brain, olfactory receptor neurons synapse onto projection neurons.

There are a large number of such ORN to PN projections, so I selected
two, the 45a and 82a, which are well reconstructed but of tractable
size.

Each circuit layer has approximately 200 synapses in total.
