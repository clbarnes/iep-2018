- Excitatory vs. inhibitory synapse size
- Synaptic size by arbor depth
- Synaptic fraction

notes:

Excitatory vs inhibitory

- in the cho-basin circuit, compare the synaptic area of lateral
inhibitory elements (drunken, griddle, handle) with ascending and
descending excitatory elements
- compare gaba-ergic and glutaminergic inputs onto motor neurons
