# Does synaptic area rectify contact number asymmetry?

notes:

- While some trends are visible in the contact number data in terms of
weakly and strongly connected partners, there are still left/right
disparities
    - developmental reasons?
        - e.g. space available
    - is normalisation a function of the hardware of the circuit,
    or does it occur in the cells?

Test:

- If one side forms more synapses, does the other side form bigger
synapses?
