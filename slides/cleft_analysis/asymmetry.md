# Analysing asymmetry

- If one cell type sends fewer synapses, does it send larger synapses?
- If one side has more synapses, does the other have larger synapses?

notes:

One of the most tractable questions to answer here is whether synapse
count asymmetry is rectified by synaptic contact area.

We can look at this between cell types in the same microcircuit, and
between contralateral pairs of the same cell types.
