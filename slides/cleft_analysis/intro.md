# Synaptic cleft morphology

- Connection strength
- Energy usage
- Neurotransmitter?

notes:

One of the most significant truncations of the raw data is to collapse
synapses into single point annotations.

The surface area of a synapse, in particular, could stand as a more
detailed proxy for connection strength than merely counting it as 1 in a
connectivity matrix.

Synapse size is also likely to affect the cell's energy requirements,
which is another major constraint in circuit activity.

Finally, different cell types and neurotransmitters may have
recognisably different synapse morphologies: being able to predict
either of these from a small static image volume rather than molecular
data or larger reconstructions would be highly valuable.

Bourne and Harris' 2011 paper showed that rat hippocampal CA1 dendrites
under an LTP regime decrease their synaptic contact number but maintain
their total synaptic surface area: an analysis which did not reconstruct
3D synapse morphologies would register only the first effect.

Synapse morphology may also vary with the location of the synapse.
Synapse activity and size may depend on the availability of ATP from a
nearby mitochondrion, or protein trafficking from the nucleus, which
gets harder in distal dendrites.

Synapses in different regions of the dendritic field could have entirely
different purposes: by treating the basal and apical dendrites of a
pyramidal neuron as distinct components, Sacramento et al. could
recapitulate crucial elements of machine learning algorithms in
biomimetic microcircuits.
