# Synaptic cleft morphology

- Synaptic strength
- Energy usage
- Neurotransmitter?

notes:

- Why are 3D clefts better than point annotations
- Massive variation in synaptic size not captured by point annotations
    - Most importantly, surface area
- Is contact number a good enough proxy for connection strength?
    - Synaptic area is important for connection strength,
        - Bourne and Harris 2011, rat hippocampal CA1 LTP
        - Aberle et al 2002, BMP receptor in drosophila
    - Connectomics generally take connection number = connection strength
    as an assumption, huge manual effort to do otherwise - not for much longer
- Does synaptic size vary with
    - cell type
    - neurotransmitter
    - depth on the dendrite
    - distance from mitochondria
