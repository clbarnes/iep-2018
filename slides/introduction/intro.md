# Enriching the connectome

How can we include more biological data in the connectome without
drastically increasing complexity?

notes:

- Node-and-edge is convenient for a number of reasons
- CATMAID-style skeleton tracing adds the possibility of different
compartments (axon vs. dendrite, basal vs. apical)
- neurochemical data is difficult to acquire at the same scale as
physical connectome
    - more tractable in smaller animals
- synaptic morphology is generally thrown away, despite synapse size
having potentially large ramifications on functional connectivity
    - Contact number as connectivity is a common assumption, which I'll
    come onto later.
    - the difference in labour between painting a synapse and clicking
    it is large: semi-automation is key
- functional connectivity at this scale is the end goal, but very
difficult to gather at scale
