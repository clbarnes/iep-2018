# Connectomes

- Nano-scale physical connectivity
- Big data: acquisition outstrips analysis

notes:

All behaviour stems from the interaction of neurons, and as such,
wide behavioural repertoires in varied environments require many neurons
and many interactions.

A large clue to these interactions lies in the constraints of which
neurons *can* possibly transfer information: this is the connectome.

Many modalities exist for uncovering connectomes at various scale
levels, serial section transmission electron microscopy offers an
excellent balance of single-synapse resolution and relatively high
throughput.

Advances in the processes for acquiring these ssTEM volumes have left us
with a lot more raw data than we can easily analyse, so we make a series
of dimensionality reductions based on reasonable assumptions.
