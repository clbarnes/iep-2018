# Conclusion

- A number of information reduction steps are taken during connectomic
analysis
- Some of these may be throwing away important information
- Extrasynaptic connections do seem to significantly change neuronal
connectivity
- A small pilot suggests that contact number is as good a proxy for
connection strength as synaptic surface area
- Semi-automation is within reach and would drastically ease scaling of
synaptic surface area measurements, as well as collection of connectome
data in general
