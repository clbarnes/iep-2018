# Conclusion

- A number of information reduction steps are taken during connectomic
analysis
- Some of these may be throwing away important information
- Extrasynaptic connections do seem to significantly change neuronal
connectivity
- A small pilot suggests that contact number is as good a proxy for
connection strength as synaptic surface area
- Semi-automation is within reach and would drastically ease scaling of
synaptic surface area measurements, as well as collection of connectome
data in general

notes:

Connectomic analysis, by necessity, involves a number of dimensionality 
reduction, some of which may be leaving important data on the table.

Extrasynaptic connections, not seen or considered in most EM-based 
connectomic analysis, may play a significant role in gross circuit 
function as implied by their effects on connectivity.

Another common assumption, that individual synapses can be treated as
atomic elements, seems to be borne out in preliminary results, at
least within single cell types.

And lastly, as semi-automation comes online, larger circuits and
comparisons are becoming tractable for further analysis of this type.
