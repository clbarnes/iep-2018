# Synapse Suggestor

- CATMAID extension
- Ilastik-based detection backend
- Partner post-processing

notes:

Split into 3 parts,
the last of which is an experiment which didn't really pan out.

Most of what I'm going to show you here is pretty old because some
updates to the underlying libraries broke it for some time,
but just this week and with input from the ilastik team I've
fixed both the breaking issue, and a major performance bottleneck.
